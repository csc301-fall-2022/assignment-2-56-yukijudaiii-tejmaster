## Web Application Name: Cashier 56

Cashier 56 is a simple-to-use web application that users can use to add/delete different items, and it also automatically calculates the total price of all products after tax. It is deployed by Heroku and can be accessed from different devices. It is also dynamically designed since it can change the layout depending on the user’s device. For this project, my partner and I decided to develop it through the web application because we have more experience developing the web than the mobile application. Also, we believe it would be easier to test and debug since we can easily see the output and spot the error. Our ultimate goal is to implement our web page efficiently and have all the essential functions.


However, the choice of what language to use to develop our application is also an important matter. In the following texts, I will analyze our views on our different options and the reason for our final decision.


For UI/frontend, since we were going to develop a web application, we had options of using one of the following languages: HTML, CSS, Node, React, etc. HTML is an excellent tool for building web pages and designing content displays, and it is also easy to write, so it became our primary choice. However, although HTML is easier for us to write, its functionality is limited. For example, we couldn’t use HTML to design a fancy webpage. Thus, we also use CSS as a style sheet to make our web applications more fancy and readable to users. By using CSS, we can change the text format, the shapes of the button, and also the animations. We believe that CSS plus HTML would be a powerful combination for UI design and frontend development, and we also have some experience with them, so they would be our best choice. However, Node and React were also considered since they are the most popular languages and include many usable built-in libraries. Still, we have zero experience, so we would just use HTML and CSS for now.


For the backend, we were thinking of using Javascript, Python, and JQuery. Since we are implementing a simple checkout price, the backend structure won’t be too complex; we can only use the backend to record the items’ attributes and do as simple adding/subtracting functions while the users are adding/deleting items. Therefore, Javascript became our primary choice since it is simple and has good interactivity with the frontend. Although it limits some more complex functions like designing algorithms, as I mentioned above, we only need simple functions so that Javascript would be the fittest language for our web application’s backend. But at the same time, JavaScript can only hold some simple functions corresponding to front-end actions. For example, you can only add the price of one corresponding item at a time. Still, you cannot calculate the names and total prices of multiple items simultaneously (the way to implement it may be very difficult). Therefore, to increase our productivity, we also use JQuery to support the use of javascript. Using Jquery, we can directly convert each item into a struct with attributes and enable them to be accurately called into the function that calculates the price. So Jquery plus Javascript became the final decision. They may not be powerful enough for the backend in general cases, but they can do our simple calculator well so that they would be very efficient. Although Python and Java are more comprehensive backend languages, we don't have any experience getting them to interact with the frontend. However, we still chose to use Python's Pytest to implement our tester since Pytest is also very efficient for testing our web applications.


For the database we didn’t implement it in this project, but we do save and keep track of each added item from the backends. Even if the data is lost whenever the server is restarted, this will not affect all our essential functions.


In summary, we chose to develop a web application for this simple checkout calculator, and our ultimate goal is to implement it most efficiently. Following our plan, we chose HTML and CSS to design the UI and develop the front since they are very efficient yet are very popular for frontend developers. For the backend, we decided to use Javascript and JQuery since they can efficiently implement all essential functions and interact well with our frontend. To conclude, Our front allows users to see the prices of all products at any time and temporarily stores the user's input, that is, the new items’ name and price, into our backend through javascript and Jquery. Therefore, cashier 56 can be used smoothly without a database.
